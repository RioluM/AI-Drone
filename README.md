# AI-Drone
Project made for one of my study subject. Drone which uses AI to choose forces made by his motors. I used fuzzy logic and neural network to compare this two AI methods. 
To symulate physics there is used Pymunk library together with pygame to have a view on a symullation. User can controll drone by keyboard.
